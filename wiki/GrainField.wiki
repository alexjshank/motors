#summary grows grain crops that the [FoodHarvester] can harvest and return to the [GrainSilo]

== details ==
  * The crops should grow at a continuous rate of 1 food unit per 10 seconds. these units aren't added to the resource bin until the FoodHarvester collects the crops and returns them to the [GrainSilo].
  * Once the crops reach a certain limit (maybe 10 food units) the crop stops growing. this is when the FoodHarvester should be ordered to collect the grain.
